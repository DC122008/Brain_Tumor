Brain tumors are a serious medical condition that can be life-threatening. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images, such as MRI scans, to identify brain tumors.<br>
However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning algorithms for brain tumor analysis.<br>
These challenges include data scarcity, data imbalance, varying tumor appearance, high dimensionality, and bias.<br>
This research project will address these challenges by developing a machine learning algorithm that can identify brain tumors with higher accuracy.<br> 
The algorithm will be trained on a large dataset of MRI images, and it will be validated on a held-out dataset.<br>
The algorithm will be evaluated based on its accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. <br>
The results of this research project will be used to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, and ultimately improve the chances of survival for patients with brain tumors.<br>
